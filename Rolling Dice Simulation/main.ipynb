    "\n",
    "In this project, I practiced using NumPy functions by simulating the rolling of two dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **np.random.randint()** → generates a NumPy array of random integers within a given range.  \n",
    "- **np.unique()** → returns the sorted unique values from an array.  \n",
    "- **np.unique(add, return_counts=True)** → additionally returns how many times each unique value appears.  \n",
    "- **zip(unique_adds, counts)** → pairs each unique value with its corresponding count, making it easy to loop through and display results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project helped me understand random number generation, array operations, and frequency counting in NumPy.\n"
